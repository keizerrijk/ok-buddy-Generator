# ok-buddy-Generator
A terminal based meme generator based on r/okbuddyretard, written in python. 

To add new words to the generator, enter lefunnywords.py, and expand one of the five dictionaries.
To enable the new words to be generated, go into okbuddyGenerator.py, and change the second random.randint value to the amount of
word in the word dictionary you edited. 

To enable new images, create a new variable, with the image, in images.py, then add a new elif in the image choice section.
